---@omw-context runtime
--[[
    Sun's Dusk addon module. NOT registered in an .omwscripts of its own.

    This file runs in TWO contexts, which is why it is `runtime` and not
    `global`:

      * sd_g.lua (GLOBAL) walks scripts/SunsDusk/settings/ with
        vfs.pathsWithPrefix and require()s every file it finds. There `world`
        is set, so the registerGroup branch below runs.
      * p_scarves.lua (PLAYER) requires it by name, the way sd_p.lua:381
        requires sd_settings. There `world` is nil, so the registerPage branch
        runs -- and the setting globals are created before the player module
        reads them.

    Annotating it `global` was wrong: half of what it exists to do only happens
    in the other context.

    That is also why the names below are read without ever being declared or
    required here. Sun's Dusk assigns them as GLOBALS on purpose (sd_g.lua
    lines 6-20), and `require` shares the requiring script's environment:

        core  types  util  world  I  animation  async  storage  MODNAME
        saveData  typesActorInventorySelf  typesActorSpellsSelf
        G_eventHandlers  G_onFrameJobs
        log                     -- a global function from constants.lua:124,
                                -- which both sd_p and sd_g require

    Every name in that list was checked against sd_p.lua / sd_g.lua /
    constants.lua rather than assumed; it is exactly the set these three files
    read, no more.

    Requiring them locally here would work but would diverge from every other
    module in that directory, and the G_* job tables have no local equivalent
    at all -- they are the host's scheduler bus.

    Static checkers will report these as undeclared globals. That is correct
    and expected; pass the list above via --globals when sweeping this mod.

	scarves_settings.lua -- Scarves & Masks settings

	Follows Sun's Dusk's own settings convention exactly, because the module
	relies on it: every key here becomes a GLOBAL of the same name, written by
	readAllSettings() below and kept current by the subscription at the bottom.
	p_scarves.lua reads SCARVES_WARMTH and MASKS_BLIGHT_RES as plain globals,
	the same way p_clean.lua reads NEEDS_CLEAN.

	`l10n = "none"` is Sun's Dusk's convention too: names and descriptions are
	literal text, not keys. Passing prose while an l10n context is set is what
	makes a control render blank.
