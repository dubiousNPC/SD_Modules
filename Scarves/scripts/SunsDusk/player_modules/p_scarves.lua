--[[
    Sun's Dusk addon module. NOT registered in an .omwscripts of its own --
    sd_p.lua (PLAYER context) walks its directory with
    vfs.pathsWithPrefix and require()s every file it finds, so this file runs
    inside that script's environment and inherits its context.

    That is also why the names below are read without ever being declared or
    required here. Sun's Dusk assigns them as GLOBALS on purpose (sd_p.lua
    lines 6-20), and `require` shares the requiring script's environment:

        core  types  util  world  I  animation  async  storage  MODNAME
        saveData  typesActorInventorySelf  typesActorSpellsSelf
        G_eventHandlers  G_onFrameJobs
        log                     -- a global function from constants.lua:124,
                                -- which both sd_p and sd_g require

    Every name in that list was checked against sd_p.lua / sd_g.lua /
    constants.lua rather than assumed; it is exactly the set these three files
    read, no more.

    Requiring them locally here would work but would diverge from every other
    module in that directory, and the G_* job tables have no local equivalent
    at all -- they are the host's scheduler bus.

    Static checkers will report these as undeclared globals. That is correct
    and expected; pass the list above via --globals when sweeping this mod.

	p_scarves.lua -- Scarves & Masks, worn state and bonuses

	Mirrors p_backpacks.lua. Where that grants a carry-weight feather scaled to
	the camping gear you are hauling, this grants:

	  SCARVES  warmth, through Sun's Dusk's temperature system
	  MASKS    blight resistance

	Both magnitudes come from settings and both are granted as ABILITY RECORDS,
	which is the only way an addon can feed the temperature system: p_temp
	scans equipped armour and clothing for its material modifiers, and a CAKE
	scarf is a Miscellaneous item that occupies no slot, so it is invisible to
	that scan. I.SunsDusk's temperature functions return display STRINGS, not
	numbers, so there is nothing to add to there either. An ability is what
	`sd_hearthfire_1..4` already are, so warmth from a scarf reaches the player
	by exactly the route warmth from a fire does.

	WARMTH IS BINARY-ENCODED, exactly as backpacks encodes feather: eight
	ability records with magnitudes 1, 2, 4 ... 128 sum to any value from 0 to
	255, and only the bits that changed are added or removed. It costs eight
	records to make one configurable number.

	Every ability is applied only `if core.magic.spells.records[id]` -- so a
	missing record degrades to no bonus rather than to an error, and the module
	still works if you strip the ability records from the plugin.
