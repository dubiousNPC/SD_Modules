# SD Eyewear v0.03

## Worn items vanished until taken off and put back on

The symptom: a worn scarf, mask or pair of goggles disappears, and only
re-equipping brings it back. Rest and loading a save showed it too.

**Cause: half of p_backpacks' sluggish job was copied.** Switching first/third
person rebuilds the player's animation object and silently drops every
attached VFX. Sun's Dusk does **not** re-attach a module's VFX for it —
`p_backpacks` notices the change itself, in its own throttled job, right beside
the inventory check. This module had the inventory check and not the camera
check, so nothing ever re-attached after a perspective switch. Re-equipping
worked because that calls `refreshVfx` directly.

### Fix

The camera check now sits in the same throttled job, as it does in
`p_backpacks`:

- It compares the **first-person boundary**, not the raw mode. ThirdPerson,
  Preview and Vanity all draw the same model, so idling into auto-vanity must
  not re-attach anything.
- The baseline advances even when nothing is worn, so a switch made while
  bare is not replayed the moment something is put on.
- Being on the throttled list is also what makes it reliable: the tick lands
  after the rebuild has finished, so the re-attach is not racing it.

`UiModeChanged` now also covers **Training** and **Jail**, which rebuild the
model exactly as Rest and Travel do.

### Tests

Four new checks in `tools/test_goggles.lua`, and they **fail on the previous build** —
verified by running them against it:

```
  FAIL vfx re-attached after switching to first person
  FAIL vfx re-attached after switching back
```

Sweep clean: luacheck, check_load, globalcheck, ctxcheck, api_sweep (all with
`--preset sunsdusk` where applicable).

# Eyewear v0.03

**Fatal load error fixed: `p_goggles.lua` killed all of Sun's Dusk.**

Log, OpenMW 0.51.0:

```
Can't start L@0x1[scripts/sunsdusk/sd_p.lua]; Lua error:
[string "scripts/sunsdusk/player_modules/p_goggles.lua"]:125:
attempt to index global 'I' (a userdata value)
```

`I.SunsDuskGoggles = { isWorn = isWorn }` assigned a field to
`openmw.interfaces`. That table is a read-only userdata; writing to it raises.
The module is `require()`d at top level by `sd_p.lua`, so the error aborted
`sd_p.lua` itself: every Sun's Dusk player module (Scarves included) was dead,
and `sd_p.lua`'s timers later failed with "Script doesn't exist".

Fix: removed the assignment. `G_gogglesIsWorn()` already served every
same-context caller (all player modules share `sd_p.lua`'s environment), so no
caller loses anything. A module cannot publish an interface at all: only a
registered script returning `interfaceName` does that.

Fixed in `TEMPLATE/p_MODULE.lua` too, which is where it came from. Any module
built from the template before v0.03 carries the same fatal line.

Checker gap: none of luacheck / globalcheck / ctxcheck flags a write to `I`,
because `I` is on the declared-globals list. A write to a host-provided global
is never legitimate in a module; worth a dedicated rule.

# Eyewear v0.02

Same verification pass run on Scarves. **Records and bones check out
completely. Four script issues, all inherited from the template — which is
where they are fixed.**

---

## What is correct

| | |
|---|---|
| `SD_Gear.omwaddon` | 110 MISC = **55 base + 55 `_eq`** pairs |
| module ids | 20 base, **all 20 resolve**, and **all 20 `_eq` twins exist** |
| `SD_Goggles.esp` | `sd_goggles_luck1` — Fortify Attribute, **Luck** (attr 7), magnitude 1, type Ability |
| ability name in code | `LUCK_ABILITY = "sd_goggles_luck1"` — matches, and guarded by `core.magic.spells.records[...]` |
| `Bip01 eyesDBS` | present in **all four** skeleton folders |

The `xbase_animkna` copy of `dubiousBones.nif` differs from the other three,
which is expected — beast skeleton. The other three are byte-identical.

No `pcall` anywhere in the module's own scripts. The `hasBone` guard with a
vanilla fallback is already in place.

---

## Issues found

### 1 & 2. Both Scarves regressions are here too

Eyewear was templated from the pre-review Scarves, so it inherited both:

**`G_settingsChangedJobs = G_settingsChangedJobs or {}`** with a named key.
Every Sun's Dusk module uses `table.insert` (`p_clean.lua:2499`,
`p_temp.lua:3752`). Both forms get *called* — consumers iterate with `pairs()` —
but this reassigns a table the host owns on an ordering assumption never
checked. If the host ever created it after this module loaded, the handler would
be silently discarded.

**`---@omw-context global`** on `goggles_settings.lua`, which
`p_goggles.lua:55` requires from PLAYER. It runs in two contexts: GLOBAL takes
the `registerGroup` branch, PLAYER takes `registerPage`. `global` describes half
of what it does. Now `runtime`.

### 3. A missing mesh failed silently

`addVfx(rec.model)` with no `vfs.fileExists` check. Eyewear meshes ship
separately, and `addVfx` on a path not in the VFS attaches nothing **and says
nothing** — the item still swaps to its worn record and the Luck ability still
applies, so a user without the mesh pack gets eyewear that equips, buffs and is
invisible, with a clean log.

Guarded and logged. `vfs` is a Sun's Dusk global (`sd_p.lua:18`), so no new
require.

### 4. A linear scan on every Miscellaneous item use

```lua
for _, b in ipairs(EYEWEAR_IDS) do
    if b == id then eqId = id .. "_eq" break end
end
```

`BASE_OF_EQ` was already a hash; the base→`_eq` direction was not. This handler
runs on **every Miscellaneous use in the game**, so it walked a 20-entry list for
every potion and every key. Added `EQ_OF_BASE`, built in the same loop.

---

## The template is the real fix

All four faults are in `TEMPLATE/`, which is where the next module would pick
them up. **Every fix is applied to both `TEMPLATE/` and the shipped module**, so
this does not recur with the third one.

That is worth stating as a rule: when a mod is generated from a template, a bug
found in the mod is a bug in the template until proven otherwise, and fixing
only the instance guarantees it comes back.

---

## Not a bug, but worth a decision

**Base and `_eq` records share the same mesh** — `dbs_rv_blindfold1_h` and its
`_eq` twin both point at `RV\blindfold1.nif`.

RESEARCH §3.1 records that Bardcraft and Sun's Dusk both attach a *different*
mesh from the one the world object uses, and Bardcraft states why outright: a
mesh attached as VFX stops being interactable until the game restarts. Sun's
Dusk reaches the same place by naming — `_g` ground mesh on the base record, the
worn mesh on `_eq`.

It also means a dropped pair of goggles renders with its *worn* mesh, which for
something authored to hang off a bone usually sits wrong.

`SD_Gear.omwaddon` is new, so this is the cheapest moment to split it: point the
base records at a `_GND` variant and leave the worn mesh on `_eq`.

---

## Verification

Cod3x 0.4. Sun's Dusk modules need `--preset sunsdusk` on the two checkers that
execute code, since the host injects its environment as globals.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `luacheck.py` (module + template) | 6 files, **0 failures** |
| `check_load.py --preset sunsdusk` | 3 files, **0 failures** |
| `globalcheck.py --preset sunsdusk` | **0 undeclared** |
| `ctxcheck.py` | **0 issues** |
| `api_sweep.py` vs Cod3x 0.4 | **nothing unrecognised** |
| `pcall` in the module's own scripts | **none** |
| `tools/test_goggles.lua` | **11/11** |

The test harness is new — Eyewear shipped none. Written fresh rather than
adapted from the Scarves one, which has two categories to Eyewear's one and
would have needed more editing than writing. It covers the equip swap, the
replacement and toggle, the ability, pass-through of unrelated items, the bone
fallback, and the missing-mesh guard. Its mock `addVfx` **asserts the path is in
the mock VFS**, so an unguarded attach fails the suite rather than passing it.

`tools/` also gained `check_load.py`, `globalcheck.py`, `ctxcheck.py`,
`check_names.py`, `api_sweep.py` and `luarun.py` — it shipped with three.
